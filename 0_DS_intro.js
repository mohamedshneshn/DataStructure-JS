/*
data ---> data types 
         -------------
         -  way of classifying the data and defining the operation on the data.
         -  used to define the operation on the data
         - ex: int, float, char, string, boolean, array, object, etc
            - ex: int x = 5;    
            - ex: float y = 5.5;
            - ex: char z = 'a';
            - ex: string name = "ahmed";
            - ex: boolean isTrue = true;

      ----> data structure
            --------------
            -  is a way to store and organize data in the memory so that we can use it efficiently.
            -  used to make data easy to access and easy to manipulate
            -  used to represent the relationship between the data
            
            built-in data structure
            ----------------------
            1-array: is a collection of similar data elements like int array, float array, char array, etc.
                   : store the data in a contiguous memory location.
                   : the size of the array is fixed.
                   
            2-object: is a collection of different data elements like int, float, char, etc.
                    : store the data in a non-contiguous memory location.
                    : the size of the object is not fixed.

            
            3-set: is a collection of unique data elements like int, float, char, etc.
                    : store the data in a non-contiguous memory location.

            4-map: is a collection of key-value pairs.
                    : store the data in a non-contiguous memory location.


            custom data structure:we used built-in data structure to create a custom data structure.
            ---------------------
            1-stack: is a collection of similar data elements like int, float, char, etc.
                    : store the data in a contiguous memory location.
                    : the size of the stack is not fixed.
                    : LIFO (last in first out) principle.

            2-queue: is a collection of similar data elements like int, float, char, etc.
                    : store the data in a contiguous memory location.
                    : the size of the queue is not fixed.
                    : FIFO (first in first out) principle.

            3-circle queue: is a collection of similar data elements like int, float, char, etc.

            4-linked list: is a collection of similar data elements like int, float, char, etc.
                    : store the data in a non-contiguous memory location.
                    : the size of the linked list is not fixed.
                    : the linked list is a linear data structure.

            5-hash table: is a collection of similar data elements like int, float, char, etc.

            6-tree: is a collection of similar data elements like int, float, char, etc.
                    : store the data in a non-contiguous memory location.


            7-graph: is a collection of similar data elements like int, float, char, etc.
                    : store the data in a non-contiguous memory location.
